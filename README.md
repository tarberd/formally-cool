# formally-cool

This is my work from an undergraduate class on theory of computation and compilers. Also an attempt to learn rust.

## What formally-cool is:

formally-cool is a library with data structs for representing regular and context free languages. 
It was made with transformations algorithms in mind such as dfa union and intersection,
nfa to dfa, rg to nfa, dfa to rg, ...

## What classy is:

An "interpreter" for a very simple langage to coordinate formally cool struct's creation and transformations.
